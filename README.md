# MoistureFunctions

This repository is archived for manuscript **" a trait-based approach to address prediction uncertainties in soil moisture-respiration relationships".** Two major modeling components are included, diffusion based nonliear kinetics analysis (in a model system) and real data simulations.

* Folder--Diffusion_nonlinear_analysis

   * This folder contains the R script used fo rdiffusion based nonliear kinetics analysis within a model system. Sensitivity analysis and graph generation are also included.

* Folder--Dataset_mmk_analysis

   * This folder contains a compiled dataset from published incubation studies (*dataset.csv*). The dataset contains measurements from 63 different soils. 
An R markdown file is provided with descriptions on the analysis and graph generation.

* Folder--Field_mmk_analysis

   * This folder contains a compiled dataset from published field observations (*field_dataset.csv*). The dataset contains measurements from 36 different soils. 
An R markdown file is provided with descriptions on the analysis and graph generation.
