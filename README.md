# MoistureFunctions

This repository is archived for manuscript " a trait-based approach to address prediction uncertainties in soil moisture-respiration relationships". Two major modeling components are included, diffusion based nonliear kinetics analysis (in a model system) and real data simulations.

1. Folder--Diffusion_nonlinear_analysis

This folder contains the R script used fordiffusion based nonliear kinetics analysis within a model system. Sensitivity analysis and graph generation are also included.

2. Folder--Dataset_mmk_analysis

This folder contains the compiled dataset from published incubation studies (dataset.csv), soil properties, moisture conditions and relative microbial respiration rates were summarized in the file. The resulting dataset consisted of data from 63 different soils, with associated moisture-respiration relationships. 
An R markdown file is provide with descriptions on the analysis and graph generation.
