# MoistureFunctions

This repository is archived for manuscript " a trait-based approach to address prediction uncertainties in soil moisture-respiration relationships". Two major modeling components are included, diffusion based nonliear kinetics analysis (in a model system) and real data simulations.

1. Folder--Diffusion_nonlinear_analysis

This folder contains the R script used to generate diffusion based nonliear kinetics analysis and all graph components

2. Folder--Dataset_mmk_analysis

This folder contains the compiled dataset from published incubation studies, the R script used for analysis and graph generation
