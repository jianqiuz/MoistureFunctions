# MoistureFunctions

This repository is archived for manuscript **" a trait-based approach to address prediction uncertainties in soil moisture-respiration relationships".** Two major modeling components are included, diffusion based nonliear kinetics analysis (in a model system) and real data simulations.

1. Folder--Diffusion_nonlinear_analysis

   1. This folder contains the R script used fordiffusion based nonliear kinetics analysis within a model system. Sensitivity analysis and graph generation are also included.

1. Folder--Dataset_mmk_analysis

   1. This folder contains a compiled dataset from published incubation studies (dataset.csv). The dataset contains measurements from 63 different soils. 
An R markdown file is provided with descriptions on the analysis and graph generation.
